        <p>Grid based design is a css framework that makes webpage layout easier. Basically, the page is devided into typically 12 equal columns which allow versitile divisability and subsequent ease of layout.  HTML elements can then be 'snapped' into this framework. </p>

        <p>Responsive web pages are those that are responsive to the screen on which they are being viewed. Typically this means that the CSS changes depending on the screen size and therefore the layout changes. This improves usabilty. This is especially important as more and more web content is viewed on smaller screened mobile devices.  </p>

        <p>Semantic structure is the process of using words or in the case of HTML, tag words, that give improved meaning.  A clasic example of this is the change in HTML5 of the 'nav' tag to replace a 'div' with a class of nav. The 'nav' element now has improved semantic meaning. </p>

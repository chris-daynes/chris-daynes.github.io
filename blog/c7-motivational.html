            <p><strong> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></p>

              <p>I read Tony Hsieh's book 'Delivering Happiness' perhaps 2 yrs ago and really enjoyed the concepts then. We are social animals and evolved in communities. It's little wonder that a sense of belonging to the community and participating to improvements in it bring real happiness. Unfortunately, modern life is far to individual focused and is likely why so mamy of us are unhappy.  And its an uphill battle. There is a massive advertising world focused on telling you that happiness comes from buying their poroducts. There is very little that we are exposed to in the main stream media that tells us otherwise. </p>



            <p><strong> From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values and what do you stand for? </strong></p>

            <p>This was a really great exercise. I will just list the words that came out. My core values are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Integrity</li>
              <li>Loving</li>
              <li>Freindship</li>
              <li>Community</li>
              <li>Honesty</li>
              <li>Self Sacrifice</li>
            </ul>

            <p>What do I stand for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fairness</li>
              <li>Sharing</li>
              <li>Looking after those with no voice - This includes the environment, low paid workers, individual rights.</li>
              <li>Freedom</li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></p>

            <p>I liked it. I do a lot of this in my everday work but this process formalised it. I am a naturally optimistic person. God I have to be! I often see life as bit of a rollercoster. </p>

            <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>

            <p>I did respond to some of the stories, especially the obituary exercise. Often I hear of people wanting to be remembered after they have died and I think this is more than a little foolish. Happiness is Now. Not later. And certainly not when you are dead! Whether or not people remember you after you are dead is irrelivant. I mean you are dead. What do you care!  So it is not a focus that anyone should entertain. </p>

          <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>

          <p>The process over product methodology actually freed me up to complete rediesign process more efficiently. It also took away anxiety as I realised that things did not have to be perfect. Focusing on process drew me deeper into my site redesign. I planed the pages before coding them up and this made the coding part clearer and simpler. The most time was spent up dating all the pages. I also iterated as I quickly realised what was going to work and what was not and how with the redisgn I could think about how the site was going to work in the future.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 2 of 'Search Inside Yourself'</h2>

          <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter two?</h4>
          <p>As I have previously mentioned, many years ago I learnt transcendental meditation (TM) and so thought that I understood the meditation process well. SIY though is a different type of meditation compared to TM. And I will address this in the next question.</p>

          <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
          <p>TM uses a mantra and doesn't focus on the self but SYI meditation is very self focused. Both attempt to distract the mind into thoughtlessness. I really linked the concept that the natural state of the quite mind is happiness. </p>

          <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out for you?</h4>
          <p>I liked the adea of just letting distracting thoughts come, not fighting them but acknowledging them and then letting them go. This removes any frustration that one may have as inevitatble thoughts distract the focus on the breath.</p>

          <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
          <p>Not really. I haven't got my routine down yet with the meditation process, which is terrible as I am aware of the benefits. My aim is to establish a routine around this.</p>

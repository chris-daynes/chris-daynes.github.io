        <p>The first chapter of 'Search Inside Yourself' introduces emotional intelligence and defines it as "the ability to monitor one's own and others feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions." It then goes on to classify it into five domains.
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Self Awareness:</strong> Knowledge of one's own internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions. </li><br>
            <li><strong>Self Regulation:</strong> Management of ones's internal states, impulses, and resources.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Motivation</strong> Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Empathy</strong> Awareness of others' feelings, needs, and concerns.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Social skills</strong> Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others. </li><br>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>The author then goes on to identify the 6 tendences that distinguish star performers and notes that all but 2 of them are founded in emotional intelligence.</p>

        <p>Finally it is noted that brains are plastic, meaning that brain function can change with repeditive tasks and that this goes for emotional intellience also. Ergo, the benefits of emotional intelligence is something that can be learned. </p>

        <p>A simple starting point for improving your emotional intelligence is working on self awareness; focusing on the breath for 2mins. As Ekhart Tolle would say "Living in the Now"</p>

        <p>So I focussed on the breath for 2mins and also on my body as I walked to the shop earlier today and I found it quite trippy. My mind normally lives in the past and the future so focusing on the present was dare I say it a "giggly" experience. </p>

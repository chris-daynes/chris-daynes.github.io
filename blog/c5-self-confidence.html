            <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></p>

            <p>It would seem that they are the same thing. </p>

            <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></p>

            <p>I tried both. Body scan is similar to something that I was taught years ago where you focus on differenct body parts. Interestingly I was taught it lying down rather than sitting up just like they paid reference to in the book. I also remember it being great for falling asleep! This time though I did it sitting up prior to meditating. I liked the feelings that I felt in my different body parts as I focused on them. These feelings I wouldn't have been aware of in everyday life.</p>

            <p>Journaling was enjoyable. I'm writing this blog after just completing my first session. I am going to do it daily and see how it goes using the book starter prompts. At the moment I feel like a just wrote down stuff about myself that I already know. Hopefully I'll discover something new!</p>

            <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></p>

            <p>This is very reminisant of Eckhart Tolle's book the power of  now. His enlightenment was his realisation that he was not his thoughts. He was that which existed behind his thought stream. </p>

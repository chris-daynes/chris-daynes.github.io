            <h1>3.2 Web Design</h1>

            <p><strong>What is a responsive website and why is it important?</strong></p>

            <p>Responsive websites are those that change layout to accommodate the screen size on which they are being viewed. It's important as more and more content is being viewed on mobile devices. If you have ever tried to navigate a full sized desktop site on a mobile sized screen device you'll know why this is important. Typically your're doing it out on the run and navigating such a site in a rush is max frustration. Therefore, as more and more people access sites on mobile devices, responsivness becomes increasingly important. </p>

            <p><strong>What is 'mobile first' and why is it important?</strong></p>

            <p>Mobile first means designing your site to load preferentially for mobile devices and only if the device is larger than this does the browser have to load more css styles. This takes the weight of the mobile device having to load a desktop page only to have to load more css to adjust for the smaller screen size. Mobile first design therefore theoretically loads faster on mobile devices. </p>

            <p><strong>What are frameworks and what are their pros and cons?</strong></p>

            <p>Frameworks are web design structures that outline frequently used design layouts such as grids. They allow faster design by avoiding repeat coding up of identical design elements. The main pro is that aesthetic layout is fast and as in the case of skeleton, responsive. The main con is that you are restricted to the layout framework.</p>

            <p><strong>What is a wireframe and why do we us it?</strong></p>

            <p>A wire frame is a pencil outline of a website showing major design layout  elements but is devoid of stylistic elements such as colours, fonts ect. It does typically include actualy content rather than lipsum lorium content so that one can see how actualy content will work in the layout. Wireframes are done before coding takes place and includes those for differing screen sizes. It allows focus on a hierachy of design elements </p>

            <p><strong>Tell a friend about when you got stuck on a simple problem.</strong></p>

            <p>Well firstly in response to this question all problems at first do not appear simple. They become simple once you've nailed it! The problem that I would like to discuss is the blue/green/invisable disc game. For some reason the programme was not running through. I focused down on where the problem lay by commenting out parts of the code, refreshing the page and seeing where the corruption lay. Finally I had it to the loop that counts through an object. Then of course I got stuck. Why was this particular bit not blimmin working. I then opened the deleoper tools and the console. There is stated an error where a class was not defined. I then instantly realised that I was using an equivalence operator rather than a dot. Boom. Working. </p>

            <p>How did I feel? Frustrated initially, but proud afterwards. I learnt that those developer tools give useful information as to the likely hold up in the code.</p>

            <p><strong>Tell a friend about when you solved a problen in an elegant way.</strong></p>

            <p>With the debugging exercise, my debugger would flip into this VM file and god knows why or where or for what purpose. I looked on the slack cohort channel and noted that I was not alone. Posted a question and Gaby answered within a short while and it was bang on. Simple, elegant and above all understandable. </p>

            <p>What I learn here was that the cohort is a great source of information. Well I knew this anyway but this was it in practice.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflection on this process.</strong></p>



            <p>All the listed techniques I have used apart from Rubber ducky. I would feel like I was going "quackers" if I did that one. I am most confident with googling but am getting better at reading error messages, console.loging, and asking the cohort for help. </p>

            <p><strong>What do these functions do?</strong></p>

            <ol>
              <li>.map()</li>
              <p>The .map() method applies a function (does something) to all elements(pieces of information) within a array(list) and returns back the modified list(array).</p>

              <li>.filter()</li>
              <p>The filter function takes an array (list of bits of information) and applies a true false test to all those individual bits of information. The function then spits out a list (array) of the bits of information (data) that passed true to the test. </p>

              <li>.reduce()</li>
              <p>The .reduce() function is a tricky beast and honestly I struggle with this one myself. But, in it's most basic form the reduce() function takes an array (list) of numbers and reduces them to a simple sum.</p>
            </ol>

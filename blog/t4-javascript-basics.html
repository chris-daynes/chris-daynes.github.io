            <p><strong>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></p>

            <p>Javascript is the programming language that makes web pages dynamic. I guess you could say that HTML is the skeleton, CSS the style, and Javascript the magic. Javascript is also a true programming language whereas HTML and CSS are not really programming languages at all.</p>

            <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life. For example "waking up" or "brushing your teeth".</strong></p>

            <p>Normally in Javascript, statements are executed one after another in the sequence that they occur in the program. Flow control changes this sequence of execution to other parts of the programme code based on the use of logic and booleans ie is something true or false.  A simple everday flow control might be "Have I fininshed eating breakfast?" If 'true', brush teeth if 'false' keep eating. I can then continue to ask myself if I have finised eating breakfast. This is looping. As long as the answer is false I will continue eating but as soon as the answer is true I will brush my teeth. </p>

            <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</strong></p>

            <p>We access array data by specifing the array name followed by it's index number. The index number is the precise location that the peice of data that you wish to access is located in the array. ie array[5] is the 6th peice of data listed in the array (0 indexed). Objects on the other hand are accesed using the object name followed by the property name in either dot or bracket notation. This is because object data is stored in 'key: value' pairs or properties. So the object bob.firstName or bob["firstName"] would list the value assigned to the object named bob with the property firstName.</p>

            <p><strong> Explain what functions are and why they are useful?</strong></p>

            <p>Functions are blocks of code that produce an output, with or without an input(s), when called upon to do so. Typically they are assigned to a variable (though can be anonymous) so that they can be called upon over and over again to do a repeditive task. Thus avoiding coding the same function over and over again in diferenct parts of your program. </p>

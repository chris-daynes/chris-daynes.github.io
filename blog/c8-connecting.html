            <p><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></p>

              <p>From my reading it appears that the nuturing of empathy helps to build trust. Empathy stems from seeing others similar to you. I reflected on this I found to my surprise that I  often focus on the differences between myself and others rather than the similarities. This was a great insight. So I have started to recite in my head when I meet new people that they are a human being just like me and that they have feelings, experiences and the like, both good and bad, just like me. That they want to me happy just like me. And I finish up saying (in my head) that I would like them to be happy. So I am trying to cultivate the habit of seeing the similar rather than the different. I tried it this morning when I took my mower in get serviced. I don't know if it changed the interaction but I liked it! Now to make it a habit. </p>



            <p><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></p>

            <p>Really well. I have been doing it with my kids (without their knowledge of course) during times of conflict. When the other person feels that you understand how they feel, de-escalation becomes the norm. But more what is also striking is the benefits to me!</p>


            <p><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></p>

            <p>The loving kindness meditation is an extension of nuturing empathy. I have not previously been a fan of directed meditations like this. I have often seen them as a bit contrived and cognitive behavioural therapy by another name. But reflecting on this it is because previously I have not believed in them. The set of words that is. With this meditaion though, I get it. I understand the process and feel the result. So, surprisingly I enjoyied it.</p>



            <p><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></p>

            <p>One situation that comes to mind for me was a few years ago I had two supervisers, one of which was away. The one that was away wanted me to attend a meeting and get certain information. The other supervisor, on the same day as the scheduled meeting via a second person asked if I would attend to another matter. I attended the original meeting and of course this upset the supervisor who was present. The conflict here is where the individual and the team interact. Also neither of us had all the information available thereby making, if you like, both of us correct as both were in the dark about certain specific peices of information.</p>

            <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>

            <p>The section on Praising People Skillfully deserves mention. I found this particularly enlightening. I am a (in)formal teacher in my role at work and as a parent (the parent bit is a little more formal), though have recieved no formal teaching or mentorship. We all want to do better than those who came before us and skillful praise has resonanted with me in a big way. It's really smart.</p>

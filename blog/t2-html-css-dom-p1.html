        <p>HTML is the structure of your house. It's the bare down bones. Like how many bedroooms, bathrooms etc. CSS is the design. CSS is what the architect does after you have decided upon the house structure (HTML). The CSS takes those bones and magically transforms them into somethiing not just good to look at but a pleasure to use.</p>

        <p>The DOM on the other hand is a map of how to get to each room in the house. With the DOM, if you follow the map, you can get to room no matter how well hidden it may at first appear.</p>

        <p>To take a design from mock-up to webpage, all the parts that make up that mock-up need be placed inside boxes. This is called 'boxification' and is the way that web page components are presented to the browser and put together to form the page as a whole. </p>

        <p>Each of the boxes used to make web pages are themselves made up of boxes. It's boxes within boxes people! There are 4 components to the box. The content (like this text you are reading now); the border (a frame around the content); padding (the area between content and border); and finally margin (the distance outside of the border). And all of these components can be modeled with CSS.  </p>

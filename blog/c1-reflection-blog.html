              <h3>Reflections on the video 'Shereef's Fireside Chat'</h3>

              <p>In this reflection I thought it easiest if I approach it using   the questions provided and so....</p>

              <p class="bold">1. What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</p>
                  <p class="indent">
                    For this one I feel it's too early to tell. At the moment it is only day 3 of the first week! I must admit to finding it very challanging already. The workload is going to be more than I thought and I can already tell that I am going to have to be very disciplined in not spending too long on certain topics otherwise I will slip behind.
                  </p>

                  <p class="bold">2. What are your impressions?</p>
                  <p class="indent">
                    I really liked Shereef's take on fear and that this is normal. I certainly feel on the inadequate side but also know that I can do it if I apply myself. He really understands his clients!
                  </p>

                  <p class="bold">3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</p>

                  <p class="indent">
                    I loved the table top culture aspect. It is more community focused rather than individual focused. Modern life places great emphasis on the individual with a winner take all sort of admiration. I am a little older than the rest of the cohort and I see this type of thing all the time.  So I am really looking forward to being part of an open communtiy where we are all in it together.
                  </p>

                    <p class="bold">4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</p>

                    <p class="indent">
                      No they haven't. I didn't really know what to expect but I hoped that they were as Shereef outlined. So if anything I am more enthused and encouraged. And also it calms my fears a little coming into this.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>

                    <p class="indent">
                      Yes I am excited and nervous. But it's an excited nervousness. I am really keen to see what I can achieve during this bootcamp. I kinda want to surprise myself.
                    </p>

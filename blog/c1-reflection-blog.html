    <h1>Reflections on the video 'Shereef's Fireside Chat'</h1>

    <p>In this reflection I thought it easiest if I approach it using   the questions provided and so....</p>

    <p>1. What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?<br>
          For this one I feel it's too early to tell. At the moment it is only day 3 of the first week! I must admit to finding it very challanging already. The workload is going to be more than I thought and I can already tell that I am going to have to be very disaplined in not spending too long on certain topics otherwise I will slip behind. And too be honest if one slips behind in the weekly workload it would be near impossible to catch up.

        2. What are your impressions?<br>
          I really liked Shereef's take on fear and that this is normal. I certainly feel on the inadequate side but also know that I can did it if I apply myself.

        3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br>
          I loved the table top culture aspect. It is more community focused rather than individual focus. Modern live is really individual focus and winner takes all sort of stuff. I am a little older than the rest of the cohort and I see this type of thing all the time.  So I am really looking forward to being part of a open communtiy where we are all in it together.


          4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?<br>
            No they haven't. I didn't really know what to expect but I hoped that they were as Shereef outlined. So if anything I am more enthused and encouraged. And also it calms my fears a little coming into this.

          5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br>
          Yes I am excited and nervous. But it's an excited nervousness. I am really keen to see what I can achieve during this bootcamp. I kinda want to surprise myself.

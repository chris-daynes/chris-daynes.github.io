            <h3>Comments on the Time and Managment Articles</h3>

            <p>Again going through the questions</p>

            <p class="bold">1. Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</p>
                <p class="indent">
                  I haven't tried any as yet. But will give the 25min thing a go. I must admit that it may not work with me as I always feel that I need at least 25mins to get 'in the zone'! And only after that do I really get going.
                </p>

                <p class="bold">2. What did you find interesting?</p>
                <p class="indent">
                  I really enjoyed the agile development stuff. I have been involved in teams for many years and find those that instigate change the most challenging. The cohort has provided some good resourses to look through and I will, time allowing, read around this topic.

                  The other thing that is exciting me is that it is clear that coding is only one skill that boot camp teaches. I am really amped about the softer skills, working with teams, and creative modern ideas around this.
                </p>

                <p class="bold">3. What worked for you?</p>

                <p class="indent">
                  I have really been interested to see the resergence of meditation to enhance proformance. I learnt transendental meditation(TM) a long time ago and found it so good. But I am embarrassed to say that like exercise, it's one of the first things to go when life gets busy. So I am going to put it back. But for those of you who read try meditating for 2mins, that simply won't cut it. It's a 20min twice a day thing. After 2mins your mind will still be racing. Your a meditation master if you can have a calm mind that quickly!
                </p>

                  <p class="bold">4. Which will you experiment further with?</p>

                  <p class="indent">
                    As above.
                  </p>

                  <p class="bold"></p>

                  <p class="indent">

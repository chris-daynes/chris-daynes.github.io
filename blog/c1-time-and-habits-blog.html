      1. Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br>

        I haven't tried any as yet. But will give the 25min thing a go. I must admit that it may not work with me as I always feel that I need at least 25mins to get 'in the zone'.

      2. What did you find interesting?<br>

        I really enjoyed the agile development stuff. I have been involved in teams for many years and find those that instigate change the most challenging. The cohort has provided some good resourses to look through and I will, time allowing, read around this topic.

        The other thing that is exciting me is that it is clear that coding is only one skill that boot camp teaches. I am really amped about the softer skills, working with teams, and creative modern ideas around this.

      3. What worked for you?<br>

      4. Which will you experiment further with?<br>

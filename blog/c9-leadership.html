            <h1>c9 Leadership</h1>

            <p><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></p>

              <p>To be brutally honest I have seen little of compassionate leadership. One manager stands out who was compassionalte in that she truely listened and tried to understand but that is one from a really large group. Although that compassionate manager was efficatious, those above her were not and so she left! </p>



            <p><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>

            <p>This was a pleasant experience. Although I cracked myself up by thinking about how big my ego was getting that I could take all that goodness and multiply it by ten. Humility please Chris. Need to be a level Five leader.</p>


            <p><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>

            <p>I found this really hard. Not the emotional aspect, but I struggled to visualise myself all glum on that mountain. I just couldn't do it. I then meditated and fell asleep. </p>




            <p><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></p>

            <p>The SCARF model incompasses Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and
              Fairness. As I was reading this chapter, the last thing I was thinking about was how this related to my experience in phase 0. I was thinking about individuls within society as a whole. You know like why someone would buy a fancy brand new car and lose 10's of thousands as soon as you drive it off the car yard. Well, that's status for you! Bit irrational.</p>

              <p>The chapter in SIY turns status around to looking inward. I'm not sure that's what the SCARF model was/is all about. I thought that status was a percieved social status. Make someone happy by giving them a fancy title but no pay. Universities do this all the time with 'honerary lecturer' status. Then they ask you to work for no monetary reward hoping that the status would be enough! </p>

              <p>So with regard to phase 0. I think that my status has gone down. My work collegues look at me like I am crazy doing this course. It's certainly not about the money! In saying this though I like to think that I am old enough to not give a damn about status externally. My car is an old Honda that I bought off one of my junior collegues! Status interanally looms always large though. I am my biggest critic. Probaly too much so.</p>

              <p>Regards certainty, I am certain that I will learn a bucket load of great stuff. Am I certain that I ultimately with know how to apply it well? Well no. There is a certain amount of autonomy within phase 0 but this must be seen within the confines of the ciriculum. There is no perceived loss of autonomy which is the important factor at play. Relatedness has been interesting. We are a diverse group and my interactions so far have been via that slackboard. They have been positive but not personal. I look forward to meeting everybody in the flesh so to speak. Regards Fairness or disruption of, this has not entered my thoughts at any time during phase 0.</p>





            <p><strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</strong></p>

            <p>I've had many difficult conversations and always think hard about them before hand and reflect on them heavily afterwards. They are difficult and I believe like negotiation is a skill gained over a lifetime and many reflections. Interestingly, hard converstaions are often their own reward. Frequently in hindsight, you are glad to have had them. When I was younger I had a number that I was coerced into and regret them to this day. Again, life-long learning. Oh yes and getting comfortable engaging in and having difficult converstions is a must in marriage!</p>



            <p><strong> Any other musings?</strong></p>

            <p>I would like the Dalai Lama to hold my hand. Just like in the book.</p>
